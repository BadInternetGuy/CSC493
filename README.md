# CSC493
Repository for my CSC 493 project. This project will be a discussion board style website. It will support a few games selected by me for the moment. 

# Files
The codebase is split up into several different files. The app.py files in the main folder controls everything else. 
The html files in the 'templates' folder are referenced in the app.py file to generate web pages. 
In addition to these, the files in the 'static' folder are mainly bootstrap files. These exist solely for aesthetic reasons. 

# Code
GameChat started off as a pretty basic idea. As I worked on it more, I started to realize that some of the functions I wanted to implement were a little over my head. For example, trying to store user input posts and then tie it to a user's login was extremely difficult, and something that I ultimately failed at. The site will allow the creation of an account, as well as the navigation to other sites. 

GameChat was also a way for me to test my knowledge on concepts that I had practiced in earlier classes. In that regard, it was a huge success. What I understand now and what I understood before I began are worlds apart. 

In any case, GameChat is a project that I would honestly like to keep working on. Both in order to test my own knowledge, and also to learn more about web development in general.
